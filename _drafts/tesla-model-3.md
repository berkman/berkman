I reserved my spot in line for a Tesla Model 3 with a refundable $1,000 deposit back in April 2016.

The reservation will allow me to order a new Model 3 before most.  Ordering priority is determined by a semi-secret formula that consists of your status as a Tesla employee, whether or not you're a current Tesla owner, the state/country you live in (west coast first), and the time/date of your reservation.

By the latest estimates on Tesla's website, the earliest that I would be able to order would be between February and April of 2018.

This would be for the more expensive "premium, longrange" model and would not be AWD (dual motor).

At almost $50,000 for a **First Production** long range model, I'd be putting it up against a number of other high performance and/or luxury vehicles.

The **Standard** model offered over the summer is more reasonable at the promised $35,000 price point, and could come down as low as $27,500 after the federal EV tax credit.
